# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was fone for the ghost accessment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This would run the server in development mode but would run both client and server in production mode

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run data:import`

This command would fill up the database with dummy users. The sequelize.rc file controls the environment.

### `npm run data:destroy`

This command would remove the dummy users.
